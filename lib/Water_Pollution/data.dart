    'text': 'Globally, 70 percent of industrial waste is dumped directly into water. Even greater than the dumping of toxic industrial chemicals is the contribution of domestic garbage and sewage, accounting for 80 percent of water pollution globally.  Asia has the highest number of polluted rivers in the world, mostly due to its dumping of raw sewage and the resulting bacteria. The sacred Ganges River takes the prize for the worldâ€™s most polluted river, carrying sewage, trash, animal carcasses and wasted food. ',

    'text': 'Globally, 1.1 billion people do not have access to clean water and 2.4 billion people do not have proper sanitation. The World Health Organization estimates waterborne diseases cause two million deaths annually, mostly of young children. These deaths were attributed to drinking water contaminated with fatal micro-organisms and inadequate hand-washing facilities and sanitation services.  The latter facilitates transfer of fatal micro-organisms through hand contact and food preparation. Deaths from the effects of toxic chemicals are less simple to pinpoint. Not surprisingly, water pollution is the major medium for typhoid and cholera.',

Cruise ships, ubiquitous now in the ocean, the largest of which can carry over 7,000 passengers and crew and on just a one-week voyage is estimated to generate 210,000 gallons of human sewage and 1 million gallons of graywater, as well as large volumes of oily bilge water, sewage sludge, garbage and other hazardous wastes. Some is treated before discharging directly into the ocean; some is not.'
