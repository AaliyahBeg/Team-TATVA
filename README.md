# Environment App

An exciting project in hand to create a greener and cleaner world to live in.

## Getting Started

I would like to work elaborately on the problem related to the layers of destruction caused to the environment. Tackling and providing solutions to all the environmental issues broadly classified into 
1) Land Pollution : will track the solid waste generation and implement the concept of 4R effectively, Buying and selling of solid waste
2) Water Pollution : Promoting Rain Water harvesting techniques,  Ground Water Levels, pH Levels monitoring
3) Air Pollution : AQI Trackers and Maps
4) Noise Pollution : Noise Level Tracking through APIs
5) Light Pollution : Nocturnal birds are affected by the street lights in the night, thus we can monitor the use of lights in the night.
Would collaborate and work upon this vision and provide solutions in form of a fully-functional fast application. The application will be made cross platform using dart framework called Flutter.
