## An impactful Environment App
* Curating by the motto :
  Purifying the Elements of Existence.


* Driven by the inspiration : 
  An exciting project in hand to create a greener and cleaner world to live in.

## Getting Started

* Get to know more about the idea :
https://www.canva.com/design/DAFdkZJ7me4/BH7MuVMDxjj7uGqkesESzA/view?utm_content=DAFdkZJ7me4&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton

* Features : 
Work elaborately on the problems related to the layers of destruction caused to the environment. Tackling and providing solutions to all the environmental issues broadly classified into 
1) Land Pollution : will track the solid waste generation and implement the concept of 4R effectively, Buying and selling of solid waste
2) Water Pollution : Promoting Rain Water harvesting techniques,  Ground Water Levels, pH Levels monitoring
3) Air Pollution : AQI Trackers and Maps
4) Noise Pollution : Noise Level Tracking through APIs
5) Light Pollution : Nocturnal birds are affected by the street lights in the night, thus we can monitor the use of lights in the night.
Would collaborate and work upon this vision and provide solutions in form of a fully-functional fast application. The application will be made cross platform using dart framework called Flutter. 

* How to run the Application :
1.  Flutter should be configured and Andriod Studio downloaded on your machine so that you are able to run the Flutter projects locally in your device.
2. To ensure your system meets the requirements to run the app. All requirements must be met to run the app.
```
flutter doctor
```
3. Git clone the project into the directory of your choosing.
```
git clone https://github.com/AaliyahBeg/Team-TATVA.git
```
4. Edit the confidential.dart file and add your Newsapi.org API, Open Weather Map API, Position Stack Geocoder API, RazorPay API keys.
```
String NewsAPIKey = "NEWS API Key Here";
String Open Weather Map ="Open Weather Map API Key Here"
String Position Stack Geocoder API= "Position Stack Geocoder API Key Here"
String RazorPay API= "RazorPay API Key Here"
```
8. Run the following commands to fetch all required dependancies.
```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```
9. Yay, you're all set to run our Application
```
flutter run 
```
It is preferred you run the app on an actual Andriod device or you can set-up your emulator from Android Studio in order to test it on Andriod :)
