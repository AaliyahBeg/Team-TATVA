Like to work elaborately on the problem related to the layers of destruction caused to the environment. 
Tackling and providing solutions to all the environmental issues broadly classified into Land, Water, Air, Noise and Light Pollution.

In this project we are having the following tracks :

2) Water Pollution :  Promoting Rain Water harvesting techniques,  Ground Water Levels, pH Levels monitoring

3) Air Pollution : AQI Trackers and Maps

4) Noise Pollution : Noise Level Tracking through APIs

5) Light Pollution :  Nocturnal birds are affected by the street lights in the night, thus we can monitor the use of lights in the night.
