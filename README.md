5) Light Pollution : Nocturnal birds are affected by the street lights in the night, thus we can monitor the use of lights in the night.
Would collaborate and work upon this vision and provide solutions in form of a fully-functional fast application. The application will be made cross platform using dart framework called Flutter.
